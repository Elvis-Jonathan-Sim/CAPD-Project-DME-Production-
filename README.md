## Introduction 
This respository was created for team project within the course of "**Computer-Aided Process Design**". The finalised merged flowsheet could be found within the file: `Final Flowsheet`. The flowsheet consists of three main sections: **"Steam-Methane Reforming"**, **"Methanol Synthesis"**, and **"Dimethyl-Ether (DME) Synthesis"**. The whole process integrates **combine heat and power plant (CHP)** in the form of *rankine cycle* to mitigate utilities requirements within the process. 

## Project Background 
Within the modern industrial engineering milieu, methanol and dimethyl ether (DME)
production are crucial processes. Methanol, also known as methyl alcohol, is the most
basic alcohol, with properties that include being lightweight, volatile, and combustible.
Beyond its physical traits, it is a vital precursor to many commercial chemicals and is
recognized for its CO2 capture and utilization.

Methanol is increasingly acknowledged as a dual-purpose fuel source, either augmenting
gasoline or substituting it, paving the way to sustainable fuel alternatives.

Likewise, DME, the simplest ether, plays a significant role in the industrial chemical
field. It is volatile, colorless, and flammable, serving as a precursor to commercial
chemicals like dimethyl sulfate and acetic acid, and is also an aerosol propellant. 

In the present work, a comprehensive industrial procedure is designed and refined,
which leverages natural gas as the initial resource to generate methanol and dimethyl
ether. This process optimization is achieved through the application of the ASPEN
Plus software. The entire mechanism is systematically compartmentalized into three
distinct stages.

The first stage involves the utilization of natural gas to synthesize synthesis gas in
a process known as steam methane reforming. The subsequent stage capitalizes on
this syngas to facilitate the production of methanol. Finally, the methanol generated is
further processed to yield dimethyl ether. This multi-step design offers a streamlined
approach to the manufacturing of these two key industrial chemical products.
